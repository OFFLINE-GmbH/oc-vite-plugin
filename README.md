## Vite âš¡integration for October CMS

This plugin provides simple integration of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for [October CMS](https://octobercms.com/) (Versions 3+).

## Setup

Install the plugin using composer

```bash
composer require offline/oc-vite-plugin
```

For the Vite integration to work, you first need to set the `VITE_MANIFEST`
env variable to the path of the manifest file generated by Vite.

```env
# /themes/your-theme/assets/build/manifest.json
VITE_MANIFEST=assets/build/manifest.json
```

Then make sure to place the `{% styles %}` and `{% scripts %}` tags in your layout,
so assets are included correctly.

## Configuring Vite

Install Vite in your theme [according to the official docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

```bash
npm install --dev vite@latest
# or
yarn add -D vite@latest
```

You can adapt the following Vite configuration to bundle your theme assets:

```ts
// themes/your-theme/vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { resolve, basename } from 'path'

// Your JS/TS/CSS entrypoints.
const input = {
    main: resolve(__dirname, 'resources/ts/main.ts'),
    css: resolve(__dirname, 'resources/scss/main.scss'),
}

const themeName = __dirname.match(/themes\/([^\/]+)/)[1];

export default defineConfig({
    // Included assets will use this path as the base URL.
    base: `/themes/${themeName}/assets/build`,
    build: {
        rollupOptions: { input },
        manifest: true,
        emptyOutDir: true,
        // Output assets to /themes/your-theme/assets/build
        outDir: resolve(__dirname, 'assets/build'),
    },
    server: {
        hmr: {
            // Do not use encrypted connections for the HMR websocket.
            protocol: 'ws',
        },
    }
})

```

## Workflow

* To use Vite in development, start the Vite server using the `vite` command
* To build assets for production, use the `vite build` command

## Including Vite Assets

Use the `vite()` function anywhere in Twig to include assets from the Vite Dev Server or the Vite manifest.json (depending on the environment).

You must provide an array of files to include as the first argument.
All paths are relative to the theme directory.

```twig
{# /themes/your-theme/resources/ts/main.ts #}
{{ vite([ 'resources/ts/main.ts' ]) }}
```

Alternatively, you can use a special `vite:` token to include files in PHP:

```php
$this->controller->addJs('vite:resources/ts/main.ts');
```

## Environments

### Dev

By default, `local` and `dev` are regarded as dev environments. If your app environment is a dev environment,
the Vite Dev Server will automatically be included for you.

You can use the following `.env` variables to configure how the Vite Dev Server is included:

```env
# These are the defaults:
VITE_MANIFEST_FILENAME=manifest.json
VITE_DEV_ENVS=dev,local
VITE_HOST=http://localhost:5173
```

### Production

If your app is configured to be run in a production environment, the plugin will automatically
use the Vite manifest to include assets.
